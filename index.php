/**
 * Additional notes for experienced PHP guys/girls:
 * This script got a big code makeover in September 2012 to make this script more professional
 * and extendable. The database connection is not created within the login class anymore, now we have own
 * classes for both things: database connection and login process. So you can easily write your
 * own classes while using the main db connection.
 * From now, we create a database connection and pass it to each new object we create
 * (Dependency Injection Pattern, by the way). This might look stupid, but it's really good stuff.
